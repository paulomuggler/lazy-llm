- I want to design a tool for branching conversations with an LLM TUI like claude code, gemini, codex, grok, etc.
- The fundamental enablement is this, to be able to at any point 'check-out' any specific point in the conversation, and continue with the chat, which will automatically 'branch out' into a new, well, branch, of conversation
- It feels like the most straightforward way to build this would be on top of git 
- it should be most fully automated, i.e., the committing and branching out happens transparently
- we need to render a nice and usable visualization to facilitate users navigating between conversation branches
- it needs to be able to manage the LLM tool's context; checking out a specific point in the conversation means clearing the current context and then injecting the state of the conversation into it so it can be continued. QUESTION: when checking out at the point of a prompt, the expectation would be, the conversation is loaded up to the last response before the prompt, and then the last prompt at that checked out point is loaded into the prompt box, ready to be modified and sent again (which would of course cause the cration of a new branch). Does that sound like the most intuitive UX?
- As mentioned, git seems like the natural fit here. Each step in the conversation (sent prompt, received LLM response) would trigger a git commit; branching out a conversation can be naturally modelled by git branching. All this is automatic, so we need to come up with good conventions for commit messages and branch names, that make it easy to see at a glance to which point in the conversation you will be moving
- QUESTION: is it feasible to have the entire thing be contained in the git messages? The full prompts, and the full responses, always in the body of the git message? Why would this be a good vs. a bad idea?
- There is also the question of some of the extra features and breaks in flow that can be done in the TUIs. For instance, in some of them you can now send prompt during reasoning to be queued up, and will be eventually processed within that reasoning round; or, you can interrupt the reasoning to give it some other prompt; and what happens to the context then? How should our tool behave in those situations?
- there is also the planned feature of being able to sync the actual workspace state, i.e., checkout the working repo state to match that of the conversation at the point of the checkout; for that we'd need to keep track of the WS commit hash in our chat commits, and maybe even manage the working space repo commits somewhat, to keep changes committed; or, on a more hands-off approach, we'd just let workspace commit management to the user project, and use whatever the current state of the repo (i.e. checked out git hash) was at the point of each chat state commit. 
- due to the repo-within-a-repo nature of our implementation, it needs reflection how that is going to be managed by us and the user; is just .gitignoreing the whole thing in the workspace repo enough, is that desirable? If going that way, how do we offer the option of managing both workspace state + chat history state in tandem? should we submodule it? NOTE: the repo-in-repo is not a requirement, it can work off of raw folder without repo (and perhaps even within other VCS, but that's secondary). But, when it is inside a workspace git repo, we need to attend to these considerations.
- what else? help me flesh this out. Let's start a new document here outlining this feature's intent, ossible UX flow, and design considerations.
