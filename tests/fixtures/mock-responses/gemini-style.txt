Absolutely! I can help you with that. Here's a Python function that meets your requirements:

```python
def sum_positive_numbers(numbers):
    """
    Filters out negative numbers and returns the sum of positive numbers.
    """
    if not isinstance(numbers, list):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list")

    positive_sum = sum(num for num in numbers if num > 0)
    return positive_sum
```

Key features:
* Type checking for input validation
* Uses generator expression for efficiency
* Returns 0 for empty lists or lists with no positive numbers

Is there anything else you'd like me to add?
