I'll help you with that.

Here's the solution:

```python
def process_data(items: list[int]) -> int:
    """Process a list of numbers and return sum of positive values."""
    return sum(x for x in items if x > 0)
```

This function:
- Uses type hints for clarity
- Filters negative numbers with a generator expression
- Returns the sum of remaining positive numbers

Would you like me to add error handling as well?
